The task was to create a comprehensive reporting on current & historical book sales performance, serve it securely and easily to selected users from SAP B1 system. Develop the reporting on totally PHP stack from data mining (directly from SAP server), business intelligence processing from 2 million rows of sales/inventory data got from data mining which done on separate microserver (local to SAP server) to reduce latency and cost and then save the report result on online server via API. Built a simple CMS with Codeigniter Framework to manage the security of report that will be viewed online via custom Access Control List module which need to be integrated with Google Business account (gmail login) as OAuth login.

Phase two: Reduce the BI processing time from more than 1 hour to 10 minutes via optimization codes utilising the server memory and changing the nature of processing flow from synchronous to asynchronous. Reduce the reporting page load speed from 2 minutes and halve to near instantaneous with Ajax.

Phase Three: Smart reporting where the system can flag which book to be reprinted and which one to be discontinued based on sales performance and previous book in genre trends. Done with very crude machine learning written in PHP. Simple algo to find pattern of 'dead' book and 'trending' book via its sales momentum.
